# misc-info

Just a repository for miscellaneous information that does not exactly fit into 
any particular project, or which can function as a sort of cross-reference to 
another project.

Note that the default branch of this repository was originally called "master." 
Now it's called "main." If you forked or cloned prior to that change, please 
synchronize anew.
