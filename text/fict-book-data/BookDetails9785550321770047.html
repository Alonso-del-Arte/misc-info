            <h1>Java Collections In Depth</h1>
            <h2>by Alonso del Arte</h2>
            <p class="genre">Nonfiction &gt; Computer programming &gt; Java</p>
            <p class="priceline">Paperback, $38.99</p>
            <p>The Java Development Kit (JDK) offers a lot more options for gathering objects into collections than just the famous <code>Array&shy;List&lt;E&gt;</code> from the <code>java.util</code> package, ranging from extending the provided abstract classes and implementing the provided interfaces to simply using the available concrete classes.</p>
            <p>In this book, Al explains how to leverage the Java collections class hierarchy and ex&shy;ten&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty with concepts gleaned from Scala's immutable col&shy;lec&shy;tions to create customized solutions for the project at hand. Includes exercises and "recipes," plus a link to a companion website with all the source.</p>
            <p>Critics hail Alonso del Arte's d&eacute;but novel as "Wait, this is not a novel. Why was I assigned to review this? The author explains things very clearly, but he also assumes knowledge that the intended audience for this book has that I don't have. Jimmy Olsen's gonna get fired. Perry! Perry!?" (Cat Grant, <i>Daily Planet</i>).</p>
            <p>First published 2019. ISBN-16: 978-555-0-32177-004-7</p>
